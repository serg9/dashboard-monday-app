## üí∞ Payment Calculation Formula

The application calculates employee payments based on the following logic:

1. **Standard Work Hours**: Each employee should work 160 hours per month (standard norm)
2. **Base Salary Calculation**: `Employee Rate √ó 160 hours = Base Monthly Salary`
3. **Actual Work Calculation**: `Hours Worked √ó Employee Rate = Amount Earned`
4. **Overpayment/Underpayment**: `Base Salary - Amount Earned = Company Overpayment`

This formula helps track whether the company is overpaying or underpaying employees based on their actual work hours versus the standard 160-hour month.
